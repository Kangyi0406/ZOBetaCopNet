Description: scCoNet is an R package designed for modeling zero-one-inflated proportion data using bivariate Frank copula models with mixture margins. It employs a two-stage estimation procedure to infer both marginal and copula parameters, and includes a two-stage likelihood ratio test for assessing the copula dependence parameter. The resulting dependence estimates serve as a robust foundation for constructing and analyzing covariation networks.
