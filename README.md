# ZOBetaCopNet
ZOBetaCopNet is an R package for modeling zero-one-inflated proportion data using Frank copula models with mixture margins. It implements a two-stage maximum likelihood estimation (tsMLE) procedure and a two-stage likelihood ratio test (tsLRT) for estimating the copula dependence parameter, which can then be used to build covariation networks.
